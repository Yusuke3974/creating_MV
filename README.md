# Creating MV

Utilities for scraping videos, preprocessing frames, training an autoencoder, and generating a simple music video.

## Installation

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management. If you do not have `uv` installed, install it via `pip install uv`.

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` is kept for compatibility, so you can also install dependencies with regular `pip` if desired.
