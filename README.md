# creating_MV

## Project Goals
This repository demonstrates a basic project structure for experiments or small machine learning tasks. It separates source code, datasets, trained models, and helper scripts into dedicated folders.

## Directory Overview
- `src/` - Source code and modules.
- `data/` - Input or processed datasets.
- `models/` - Saved model files or checkpoints.
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts for running experiments or training.

## Basic Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
3. Install any required dependencies.

## Instructions
- Place your implementation files inside `src/`.
- Add datasets to the `data/` directory.
- Use scripts in the `scripts/` folder to run training or preprocessing tasks.
- Store any generated model artifacts in `models/`.
